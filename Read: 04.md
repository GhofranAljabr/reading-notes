### Flow control
The control flow is the sequence in which a script's statements are executed by the computer.


Unless the computer encounters (very common) structures that affect the control flow, such as conditionals and loops, code is executed in order from the first line in the file to the last line.



Consider a script that is used to validate user data from a site form. The script was submitted.
