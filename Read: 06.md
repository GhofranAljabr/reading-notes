# Control flow
------------------------
*** The control flow is the sequence in which a script's statements are executed by the computer.
Unless the computer encounters (very common) structures that affect the control flow, such as conditionals and loops, code is executed in order from the first line in the file to the last line.
Consider a script that is used to validate user data from a site form. The script sends approved data to the server. ***

------
if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}

## JavaScript Functions
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
---
Example
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}

## JavaScript Operators

**Example**

Assign values to variables and add them together:

var x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
var y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
var z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)
