# Html:-
### When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space.Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.
* To add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use - the line break tag <br />.
* To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag.
- By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
* By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.
- The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.
* The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as.

### Js:-
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. • Each of the lines of code in green is a statement. • The pink curly braces indicate the start and end of a code block. (Each code block could contain many more statements.) • The code in purple determines which code should run (as you will see on p149)
JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to HourNow or HOURNOW.
