## Wireframe and Design 
*What is a wireframe, and why are they used by UX designers?
Wireframing is a UX design technique that allows designers to establish and arrange the information hierarchy of a website, app, or product. Based on the user research conducted by the UX design team, this approach focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to digest information on a site.*

## Mozilla HTML Basics

So, what exactly is HTML?
HTML is a markup language that specifies how your material is organized. HTML is made up of a set of elements that you may employ to enclose or wrap certain parts of your content to make it seem or perform a certain manner. The surrounding tags can be used to make a word or image hyperlink to another location, italicize words, change the font size, and so on. As an example,*

Anatomy of an HTML document
That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
  </body>
</html>

## Semantics
*Semantics is a term used in programming to describe the meaning of a piece of code, such as "what impact does running that line of JavaScript have?" or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have?" (rather than "what does it look like?").*

*In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?*

### Semantic elements
These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

* <article>
* <aside>
* <details>
* <figcaption>
* <figure>
* <footer>
* <header>
* <main>
* <mark>
* <nav>
* <section>
* <summary>
* <time>
